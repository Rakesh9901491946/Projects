## Usage Guide 📖

1. **Scraping Data**: Use the `scrapy` module to scrape candidate data from Stack Overflow.
   ```bash
   scrapy crawl stackoverflow_scraper
   ```
2. **Preprocess Data**: Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare data.
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
3. **Cluster Candidates**: Use the K-Means clustering script to evaluate and group candidates.
   ```bash
   python cluster_candidates.py
   ```
4. **Run Automated Coding Tests**: Initiate coding tests and generate feedback through the Flask interface.

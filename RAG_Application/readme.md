# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Application

## Description
This project showcases a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation application leveraging Python, LangChain, and the OpenAI API. It integrates advanced natural language processing technologies to enable efficient information retrieval and real-time content generation, making it a powerful tool for developers and researchers interested in AI and machine learning.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rakesh9901491946/rag-application.git
cd rag-application
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To start using the RAG application, run the following command:
```python
python app.py
```
## Features
- **Custom Retrieval System**: Utilizes vector space models for semantic similarity.
- **Dynamic Information Synthesis**: Sources information from diverse datasets to produce contextually relevant results.
- **Modular Design**: Easy integration and customization with LangChain components.

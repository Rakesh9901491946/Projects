# Spotify-SQL-Project
This project features a collection of SQL queries crafted to extract distinct insights from a simulated Spotify database.
## Purpose
The Spotify SQL Project uses SQL queries to explore and understand a typical music store’s data. The queries aim to answer important questions about Spotify’s operations, customer habits, and sales, offering useful insights that can help improve the business and increase profits.

## Data
The data is stored in several tables within the database. Based on the queries, some of the tables include employee, invoice, customer, invoice_line, track, genre, artist, and album.

## Analysis Approach:
The project is segmented into three tiers of complexity: Easy, Moderate, and Advanced.

- Easy Level: Features basic queries that focus on direct data retrieval, such as pinpointing top customers or employees.

- Moderate Level: Encompasses intermediate queries that dig deeper, using complex JOIN operations, GROUP BY clauses, and aggregate functions like SUM and COUNT to derive more nuanced insights.

- Advanced Level: Showcases the power of advanced SQL techniques. It prominently uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions like ROW_NUMBER to answer complex queries.


## SQL Constructs Used:
The project showcases a wide range of SQL constructs to address various querying needs:
- Data Retrieval: SELECT, DISTINCT, and FROM.
- Filtering: WHERE, IN, and LIMIT.
- Aggregation: SUM, COUNT, AVG.
- Sorting: ORDER BY.
- Joining Tables: JOIN.
- Grouping Data: GROUP BY.
- Window Functions: ROW_NUMBER.
- Subqueries and Derived Tables: WITH (for CTEs).
